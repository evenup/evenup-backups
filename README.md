## Overview

Puppet module to install the ruby backup gem and create jobs to back up various services and directories.

## Module Description

The ruby backup gem allows backing up files and various databases and optionally compressing, encrypting, and splitting them into smaller chunks, and copying them to remote systems or file storage service.

This module will install the backup gem, but more powerfully allows the creation and scheduling of jobs based on the backup DSL.

A script is provided in the scripts directory to create a standalone RPM with [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki) which includes a global binary to run jobs.

## Setup

### What backup affects

* backup ruby gem
* backup config files
* backup job cron entries

### Setup Requirements

Dependencies to build ruby gems (and backup and it's dependencies specifically) need to be installed for this module.  It can optinally install all needed dependencies from a base system.

### Beginning with backup

To install backup:

```
    puppet module install evenup-backups
```

## Usage

To install the backup gem:

```puppet
    class { 'backup': }
```

Creating a backup job to archive /etc to the local path /backups:

```puppet
    backup::job { 'etc':
      types        => 'archive',
      add          => '/etc',
      storage_type => 'local',
      path         => '/backups',
    }
```

Create a backup job to archive a riak database and its config, compressing, splitting into 1G chunks, and copying to S3 on Sundays at 01:10:

```puppet
    backup::job { 'riak':
      types          => ['archive', 'riak'],
      add            => '/etc/riak',
      cookie         => 'supersecret',
      storage_type   => 's3',
      compressor     => 'bzip2'
      level          => 9,
      split_into     => 1024,
      aws_access_key => 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY',
      aws_secret_key => 'AWS_SECRET_KEY',
      bucket         => 'backup-bucket',
      weekday        => 0,
      hour           => 1,
      minute         => 10,
    }
```
